What operations form the basis of a web application? Can we narrow them down to a set of reliable operations applicable to any situation?

The four primary operations that a web application must be able to perform fall into the acronym **C.R.U.D:**

- create - the act of creating a new set of data or inserting an element into an existing set
- read - finding and retrieving existing data
- update - modifying a currently existing data point to a new value
- delete - removing a set of data or element of data from a set

These operations form the basis of an application as it covers the range of ways a user can interact with a website.

For example, a user interacting with Facebook might:

- create - create a post to share on their wall or upload an image from their phone
- read - get a curated collection of posts their friends have made recently on their wall or pull up their list of contacts
- update - change their status, edit a recently created post, or react to something on their wall
- delete - remove a friend from their friends list or delete a post

We will be seeing these C.R.U.D. operations come up in many ways across different contexts. Whenever you see an operation performedâ€”try to connect it to one of the C.R.U.D. concepts!
