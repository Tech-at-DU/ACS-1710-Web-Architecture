ðŸ¤” What if we need to render different views based on the `context` values created by the user within the same route URL?

---

The `Jinja2` templating syntax supports conditional statements and can render different views depending on the values within the `context` object passed to the template.

To utilize conditional statments in `Jinja2`, the if statement must be wrapped in a single curly bracket and percent sign as follows: `{% if/elif/else boolean expression %}`.

```python
# a Python route with one route variable and a context object
@app.route('/fact/<animal>')
def animal_fact(animal):

   context = {
       'animal': animal
   }

   return render_template('fact.html', **context)
```

```html
<! -- conditional statements in Jinja2 -- >
{% if animal == 'aardvark' %}
   Aardvarks can eat up to 50,000 insects each night! They swallow their food whole, without chewing it.
{% elif animal == 'penguin' %}
   A penguinâ€™s black and white plumage serves as camouflage while swimming.
{% elif animal == 'zebra' %}
   A zebra's stripes serve to dazzle and confuse predators and biting insects.
{% else %}
   I don't have any facts about that animal. Please try again!
{% endif %}
```

Note: notice that the conditional loop always ends with an {% endif %} statement! A syntax error will occur if this does not get included.
