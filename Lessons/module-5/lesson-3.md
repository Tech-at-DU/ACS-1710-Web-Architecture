ðŸ¤” How do we connect a Flask server with API routes to a MongoDB database cluster?

</aside>

---

The `Flask` object has a built-in property called `config` which allows developers to easily create **configuration variables** (see the **environment variables** lesson for relevant information) with the Python dictionary syntax: `app.config['URL_ROUTE'] = 'URLdestination'`

Using this `config` property, developers can create globally accessible URL connection points to help the Flask server find the MongoDB cluster destination.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Once a Flask server gets connected to a MongoDB clusterâ€”we must use the PyMongo library to create a `mongo` object capable of interfacing between the server and database!

</aside>

```python
# create a Flask server, connect it to a MongoDB cluster, then make a mongo object
from flask import Flask
from flask_pymongo import PyMongo

app = Flask(__name__)

# create a configuration variable called MONGO_URI,
# this connects the Flask server to the MongoDB cluster location
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = "mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase"

# create a Mongo object using the PyMongo library that can interact with MongoDB
mongo = PyMongo(app)
```

*Fig 1 - importing the Flask and PyMongo Python libraries, creating a Flask server, and connecting the server to the MongoDB database via a `config` variable*

- *Note: all operations between the server and the MongoDB database must be performed through the `mongo` object!*
