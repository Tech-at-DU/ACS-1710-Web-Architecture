ðŸ¤” How can we manage all of the development environments on our computerâ€”especially if several projects have conflicting dependencies?

</aside>

---

Large scale applications and projects will often times require multiple coding languages and production environments in order to function properly. For example, the front-end and back-end might use the same programming languages with different dependencies, and the product must account for users running older versions of a product!

How can all of these dependencies and environments get managed effectively?

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Virtual environments allow different projects to have unique dependency "spaces" that ensures conflicts do not occur, and that each area of a product has exactly what it needs to function.

### Creating Virtual Environments with `venv`

The Python library `venv` enables developers to quickly create, activate, and deactivate Python virtual environments.

Use the following commands to get started with `venv`:

1. `venv` comes installed with Python3 so no installation needed!
2. creating a new `venv` within a directory: `python3 -m venv env`
3. activating an existing `venv`: 
    1. navigate to the directory containing the `venv` (in this case the directory hasn't changed yet and the `venv` instance uses the name `env`)
    2. use the command: `source env/bin/activate`
4. deactivating an active `venv`: `deactivate`

### Loading Dependencies via `requirements.txt`

A fresh project will often contain a file called `requirements.txt`. This file contains all of the dependency information needed to recreate the project environment.

To install all the dependencies packages in a `requirements.txt` file use the following commands:

1. navigate to the directory containing `requirements.txt`
2. use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all listed packages

A good practice to implement after adding new dependencies project would be updating the `requirements.txt` file associated with the project. This can be done with the following command:

- `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
