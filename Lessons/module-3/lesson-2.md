ðŸ’¡ C.R.U.D operations work their way into just about every aspect of web applications! Including the way developers interact with other platforms/services.

Let's breakdown some examples of how C.R.U.D manifests in API's:

- create - using the Twitter API to draft and send a Tweet in an application other than Twitter
- read - retrieving the current number of trains operating via the BART API
- update - Stripe payment plugins that allow payments to be sent directly from a web application to a bank account
- delete - censor bots capable of detecting (i.e. **reading**) and removing posts on Facebook that break the terms and conditions of usage
