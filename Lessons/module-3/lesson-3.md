`JSON` stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. 

<aside>
ðŸš¨ A `JSON` object can be used by languages other than Javascript! `JSON` objects find their origins in Javascript and therefore look similar to themâ€”but `JSON` objects also look quite similar to Python objects too.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Many programming languages can interpret `JSON` objects because they are nothing more then an **object notation**â€”which means that the object always uses the same predictable **key-value** pairs.

</aside>

```json
{
	"type": "success",
	"value": {
		"id": 493,
		"joke": "Chuck Norris can binary search unsorted data.",
		"categories": ["nerdy"]
	}
}
```

Fig *1 - a `JSON` object with several **key-value** pairs.*

- *Note: A `JSON` object looks identical to Python's `dictionary` data structure because both use the same **key-value** pair format*

<aside>
ðŸš¨ Notice that the `JSON` object in *Fig 1* does not have any variable declarations! `JSON` objects exist to be packaged and/or sent across the internet. As a result, a `JSON` file only contains object data **to be assigned by the requesting function.**

</aside>

Since `JSON` objects always use the same notation pattern and can be transported efficently, they have become a standard API format to utilize for passing data across networks.

```python
# a JSON object translated into Python
my_info = {
   'name': 'Fluffy',
   'likes': ['tennis balls', 'walks'],
   'address': {
       'street': '555 Post St',
       'city': 'San Francisco'
   }
}

# accessing the `my_info` object's `address` property, then the `street` property
street_address = my_info['address']['street']
```

*Fig 2 - a `JSON` object implemented into a Python file*

- *Consider how a `JSON` object can be assigned to a Python variableâ€”would it be possible to import the `my_info` data from a `JSON` object instead of hard coding it here?*
- *Note: Notice how each of the object's properties must be accessed to go deeper into the child objects*
