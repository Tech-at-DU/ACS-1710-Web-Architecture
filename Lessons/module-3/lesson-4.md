# Exercises ðŸ’ª

1. Download the [Postman desktop application](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#installing-postman-on-mac). 
2. Make a query to the Chuck Norris Joke API by using the [API Documentation Page here](https://api.chucknorris.io). Make sure it sends you a response back containing a joke!
3. Send a screenshot of your request to your instructor.

Once a API route has been created, it should always be tested in a development environment before rolling out to production. Many tools and techniques exist to test an API quicklyâ€”but in this class we will be using a tool called **Postman**.

Similar to an internet browser, Postman allows developers to make requests and recieve respones. Postman provides additional tools on top of the traditional intenet browser such as the ability to quickly shape the method of request (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), the query parameters of the request, and request tracing for easier debugging.
